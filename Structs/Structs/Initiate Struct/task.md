## Initiate Struct

Complete all TODO fields to make the tests pass!
You should define a Classic Struct with two fields: "name" and "hex" and then create an instance of this struct with values "green" and "#00FF00" corresponding to these fields. 
You should also define a Tuple Struct with two string-type fields and instantiate one with the same values as before. 
Finally, you need to instantiate a Unit Struct and make sure our program prints the message "UnitStructs are fun!" :)

<div class="hint">
Rust has more than one type of struct. Three actually, all variants are used to package related data together.
There are normal (or classic) structs. These are named collections of related data stored in fields.
Tuple structs are basically just named tuples.
Finally, Unit structs. These don't have any fields and are useful for generics.

<div class="hint">
In this exercise you need to complete and implement one of each kind.
