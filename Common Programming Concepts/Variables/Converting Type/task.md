## Converting Type

Make me compile!

<div class="hint">
  In Mutable Variable Binding we already learned how to make an immutable variable mutable
using a special keyword. Unfortunately this doesn't help us much in this exercise
because we want to assign a different typed value to an existing variable. Sometimes
you may also like to reuse existing variable names because you are just converting
values to different types like in this exercise.
Fortunately Rust has a powerful solution to this problem: 'Shadowing'!
You can read more about 'Shadowing' in the book's section
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing">'Variables and Mutability'</a>. 
Try to solve this exercise afterwards using this technique.
