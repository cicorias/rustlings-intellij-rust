## Modifying a HashMap

A basket of fruits in the form of a hash map is given. The key
represents the name of the fruit and the value represents how many
of that particular fruit is in the basket. You have to put *MORE
THAN 11* fruits in the basket. Three types of fruits - Apple (4),
Mango (2) and Lichi (5) are already given in the basket. You are
not allowed to insert any more of these fruits!

Make yur code pass the tests!

<div class="hint"> Use the `entry()` and  `or_insert()` methods of `HashMap` to achieve this.</div></li>
